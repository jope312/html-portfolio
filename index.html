   <h2>Roasted Peppers Beef Jollof Rice</h2>
   <p>This is a great basic rice recipe that is easy to prepare. The only difference between my preparation of this rice and my classic Nigerian jollof rice recipe is that I roasted the peppers, tomatoes,  onions, and garlic before using them to cook the rice. This makes a TREMENDOUS difference to the final presentation.</p>
   <p>Well, I also used basmati rice and beef stock to give it a rich beefy taste. You can check out my collection of Rice Recipes for more delicious.</p>

   <h2>Frequently asked questions about jollof rice</h2>
<br>
<h2>What type of basmati rice works for this jollof rice?</h2>
<p>To get the best out of your jollof rice, it’s advisable to get a good brand of basmati rice. It makes a huge difference in the final texture. I personally prefer to use the sella parboiled Extra Long Basmati Rice. It works so well.</p>

<ul>
     <li>Once the rice is mixed with the sauce, cover it immediately with a tight-fitting lid or with foil paper and then a lid. This will make sure the steam stays trapped in the pot. This steam is what is needed to soften the rice.</li>
     <li>Next, you need to leave the rice to cook for about five minutes on medium to low heat.  After that, turn the heat to low and cook for 20 more minutes. Do not open it, peek, or stir during these 20 minutes. Opening the rice constantly will make it sticky and clumped together.</li>
     <li>After that, you can check it; if there is still more liquid, cook till the liquid is dry, and if the rice is not soft enough, continue to steam it for another few minutes until it’s done to your satisfaction.</li>
     <li>Yes, your rice will burn slightly. That is why it’s very important to cook it on low heat. High heat for too long will cause it to burn or dry out.

<h2>How to Store Leftover Basmati Jollof Rice</h2>

        The best way to store leftover Basmati Jollof Rice is in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for up to 5 days in this state, but we recommend eating it within 3 days for optimal flavor and texture. If you plan on keeping it longer than 5 days, freeze it! You can also reheat your leftovers by putting them back into a saucepan or microwave (if they were originally cooked in one).</p>

<p>The preparation of Jollof varies from family to family. However, traditionally, Jollof contains the following</p>

<ul>
    <li>Peppers – Choose bright red pimento or bell peppers it helps to brighten the color of the rice.</li>
    <li>Tomatoes – Ripe red juicy tomatoes work best for this recipe.</li>
     <li>Onions – I have tried using different varieties of Onions. I love it all. Any variety works well for me.</li>
    <li>Chicken Stock – I always use homemade chicken stock. However, any</li>
    <li>Long Grain Rice – I always like to use the long grain Rice usually labeled as “Parboiled long Grain rice”. An example is the uncle ben’s Rice. This type of rice is more durable – it doesn’t get mushy easily. Note that, there are other good brands out there that are not as expensive as the brand I mentioned.</li>
    <li>Vegetable Oil – Any good vegetable Oil will work for this recipe. However, I will suggest peanut Oil (groundnut Oil) or any other mild tasting oil – A strong tasting Oil might affect the overall taste of this dish</li>
    <li>Other Ingredie  </li>
       <ol>
           <li>salt</li>
           <li>Thyme</li>
           <li>curry powder</li>
           <li>Stock cubes</li>
           <li>Bay leaves</li>
           <li>Ginger</li>
           <li>garlic</li>
       </ol>

         
       <ul>
<li>Carrots</li>

<h3>NOTES</h3>
<ul>
<li>You will need an oven-safe pot or pan for this recipe.</li>
<li>The total liquid content of the Sauce is 4 Cups for the 3 cups of dry Rice. You may need to reduce this by half of a cup if you use Basmati Rice or Jasmine Rice.</li>
<li>You can add more water if you feel the Rice is still hard after your cooking time but make sure you add a little at a time because a little water goes a very long way.</li>
<li>It’s advisable not to open the oven until after about 45 minutes so that the trapped steam in the Oven will not escape. </li>
